    <string name="audio_ducking_disabled_title">Audio Ducking Temporarily Disabled</string>
    <string name="audio_ducking_disabled_message">Due to inconsistencies with how different devices handle Audio Focus requests, the Lower Audio option has been temporarily disabled by default. If you are able to help get this feature working, please contribute to this project on GitHub. You can re-enable this feature for development or experimentation purposes by going into Development Settings -> Enable Audio Ducking. It may work on some devices, but I cannot offer general support for it at this time.</string>
